How to start

Logging

For better better visibility there was user console output for logging process. However it is possible to use any other logging framework or build-in java classes.

Test units

There were not used mock for mocking some functionality because there is no necessity however for bigger system mocking objects is rather relevant.

Questions:
Formatting of examples a bit confusing because we save formatting as xml for some strings and change the format for others. It is needed more examples to understand a pattern.
